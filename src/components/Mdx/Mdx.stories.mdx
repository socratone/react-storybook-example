# Badge

Let's define a story for our `Badge` component:

<Story name="default">
  <Badge>DEFAULT</Badge>
</Story>


We can drop it in a `Canvas` to get a code snippet:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="blue">
    <Badge color="blue">BLUE</Badge>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

We can even preview multiple stories in a block.  
This gets rendered as a group, but defines individual stories  
with unique URLs and isolated snapshot tests.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="red">
    <Badge color="red">RED</Badge>
  </Story>
  <Story name="yellow">
    <Badge color="yellow">YELLOW</Badge>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
